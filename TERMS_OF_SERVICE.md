# FODMAP Living Terms of Service

Effective Date: 2025-09-06  
Version: 1.0

_Last Updated: 2025-09-06_

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the FODMAP Living mobile application and related services (the "Services"). By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By installing, accessing, or using the App you: (a) confirm you are legally capable of forming a binding contract; and (b) agree to comply with these Terms and all applicable laws.

## 2. Eligibility
The Services are intended for individuals at or above the age required by local law to form a contract (typically 13–18+ depending on jurisdiction). The App is not directed to children under 13. You represent you meet the applicable age requirement.

## 3. Not Medical Advice
FODMAP Living provides AI-assisted ingredient recognition and potential FODMAP-related insights for informational purposes only. It is NOT a substitute for professional medical, diagnostic, or dietary advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional or registered dietitian before making dietary changes or relying on outputs provided by the App. Do not disregard, avoid, or delay seeking professional advice because of information obtained from the Services.

## 4. Account & Security
Some features may require a persistent pseudonymous account or authentication token. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any tokens or credentials and for all activities under your session. Notify us promptly of suspected unauthorized access. We may suspend access to protect you and the Service.

## 5. Subscriptions, Billing & Renewal
### 5.1 In-App Purchases
Certain features require an active paid subscription purchased through Apple’s App Store using in-app purchase mechanisms. Billing is handled by Apple; we do not collect or store your full payment details.

### 5.2 RevenueCat Entitlements
We use RevenueCat to manage subscription status and entitlements. Your access is based on the entitlement(s) reported by RevenueCat (e.g., "Premium").

### 5.3 Auto-Renewal
Subscriptions may automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless canceled at least 24 hours before renewal. You can manage or cancel in your Apple ID subscription settings.

### 5.4 Trials & Introductory Offers
If offered, free trials or introductory pricing convert to a standard subscription unless canceled before the trial ends. Eligibility is determined by Apple’s and RevenueCat’s systems.

### 5.5 Refunds
All billing inquiries or refund requests must be directed to Apple (App Store). We cannot directly process refunds for in-app purchases.

### 5.6 Price Changes
We may adjust pricing prospectively. Existing subscriptions follow Apple’s price change policies (notification and acceptance where required).

### 5.7 Usage Limits
Your plan may include daily or monthly usage limits (e.g., number of analyses). Exceeding limits may temporarily restrict access until reset or upgrade.

## 6. License Grant & Restrictions
Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the App solely for personal, non-commercial purposes. You must not:
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App except as permitted by law
- Circumvent security, rate limits, or usage controls
- Use automated scripts or scraping on endpoints beyond documented use
- Rent, sell, sublicense, or exploit the App commercially without permission
- Use the Services for training a competing AI model

## 7. User Content
"User Content" includes meal images, text inputs, ingredient notes, feedback, and any other material you submit. You retain ownership of your User Content. You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to process, display, and store User Content solely to provide and improve the Services. Where permitted, we may aggregate or anonymize data for analytics and performance optimization.

You represent you have rights to the User Content and it does not infringe or violate third-party rights or applicable laws.

## 8. Prohibited Uses
You agree not to use the Services to:
- Upload unlawful, harmful, defamatory, or deceptive content
- Transmit malware, spam, or automated abusive traffic
- Harass, threaten, or violate privacy of others
- Probe or test system vulnerabilities without authorization
- Misrepresent affiliation or impersonate another person

## 9. Intellectual Property
All intellectual property rights in the App (excluding User Content) are owned by us or our licensors. All trademarks, logos, and service marks are the property of their respective owners. No rights are granted except as explicitly stated.

## 10. Third-Party Services & Links
The Services rely on third-party providers (e.g., OpenAI, RevenueCat, Apple). Their terms and privacy practices govern your use of their components. We are not responsible for third-party content or services outside our control.

## 11. Disclaimers
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE; (B) ANALYSIS RESULTS WILL BE ACCURATE OR COMPLETE; OR (C) DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED PROMPTLY.

## 12. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (A) AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU (IF ANY) IN THE 6 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM; OR (B) USD $25.

Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain damages; portions of the above may not apply to you. Nothing limits liability that cannot be excluded by law.

## 13. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless FODMAP Living, its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your use of the Services; (b) your User Content; (c) violation of these Terms; or (d) infringement of any third-party rights.

## 14. Termination
We may suspend or terminate access (with or without notice) if you breach these Terms or if required for security, legal, or operational reasons. Upon termination, your license ends and you must cease use. Sections that by nature should survive (e.g., Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Governing Law) shall survive termination.

## 15. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict of law principles). You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in California for any disputes not subject to arbitration (if arbitration later added by policy update). International mandatory consumer protections remain unaffected where applicable.

## 16. Changes to Terms
We may update these Terms. Material changes will be communicated in-app or via update notes. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance. If you disagree with changes, discontinue use before the changes take effect.

## 17. Export & Compliance
You represent you are not located in, under control of, or a national/resident of any sanctioned country and not on any denied parties list. You agree to comply with applicable export control laws.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Services and supersede prior or contemporaneous understandings.

## 20. Severability
If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions remain in full force.

## 21. Waiver
Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.
